1) 2강 Babel(배블) and Meteor
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that compiles ES6 syntax
to older JavaScript syntax that will work across existing browsers.

Babel is used by many companies including Facebook and Netflix.
In addition to its basic job as a compiler,
it's also a great learning tool.

We can use it to see how to implement the new ES6 features
using familiar JavaScript syntax.

Meteor is a full stack web framework
that uses Babel under the hood to support ES6.

We'll be using Meteor in this class to easily get up and running.
